# Katana Network (React Version)

This is a React + Vite reconstruction of the Katana Network website.

## Getting Started

1.  **Install Dependencies** (if you haven't already):
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Start Development Server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3.  **Build for Production**:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

## Project Structure

-   `src/components/`: Individual React components (Header, Hero, etc.)
-   `src/styles/`: Global styles and design tokens
-   `public/`: Static assets (3D models, images, videos)

## Key Features

-   **Vite**: Fast development server and build tool.
-   **React Three Fiber**: 3D scene rendering for the floating coins/background.
-   **GSAP**: Advanced animations for scroll interactions.
-   **Modular CSS**: Clean, component-scoped styling replacement for the original minified CSS.
